# Isaac Woodward - Robotics & Controls Engineer

## Overview
I'm a graduate mechanical engineering student currently pursuing a Master's thesis in robotics and controls at the University of Missouri - Kansas City! I have a strong background in programming (C++/Python/MATLAB), embedded systems, finite element analysis/simulation, control system design, and CAD/3D Modeling. I'm passionate about all things engineering and am always trying to learn new things!
